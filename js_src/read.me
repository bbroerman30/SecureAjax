js_src
======

This directory contains reference versions of all Javascript source used in the actual SecureAjax project. It is not needed when using the library, but is included here for your reference.

I am still in the process of reformatting and documenting all of the code, but there should be enough here to get you started in understanding how it all works.

If you have questions, email me and I will try to answer as I can.
